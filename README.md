# PYICEBERG, DUCKDB & MINIO PoC

## USE CASE

Post-Trade Venue XYZ has set up an API where the trading members can submit trades against each other. These trades feeds to the trading venue real time and are then aggregated intra-day and end of the day in order to obtain the net exposure by trading participants.

As trading participants can buy and sell, take long and short positions their overall exposure to the trading venue XYZ can fluctuate intra-day leading to positions of different size and different directions.


## FULL STACK

This handout provides an overview of three key technologies in modern data lake architecture: MinIO, Apache Iceberg, and DuckDB with PyIceberg.

## MinIO

MinIO is a high-performance, cloud-native object storage system designed for scalability and efficiency7. It offers a unified storage solution for modern data lakes that can run anywhere, including private clouds, public clouds, and bare metal environments.

MinIO stands out as an innovative solution for structuring data lakes due to its:

- Cloud-native design, enabling multi-cloud and hybrid-cloud deployments.
- Use of erasure coding, providing better storage efficiency and resiliency compared to traditional Hadoop clusters.
- Optimizations for small files, which aligns well with data lake formats like Delta Lake and Iceberg4.

As an object storage solution for Iceberg, MinIO offers several advantages:

- **Active** active replication for multi-geo resiliency and fast failover4.
- **Efficient** handling of small files, which is crucial for Iceberg's transaction logs and metadata files.
- **Compatibility** with cloud object stores like Amazon S3, allowing for seamless integration with existing cloud infrastructure.

## Apache Iceberg

Apache Iceberg is an open-source table format for large analytic datasets, designed to improve upon older systems like Hive.

Key features of Apache Iceberg include:

- File-level data tracking, improving efficiency on object storage systems.
- Advanced metadata management, allowing for faster updates and deletes.
- Snapshot-based versioning, enabling time travel and rollback capabilities.

Iceberg has largely replaced Hive in modern object storage-based data lakes for several reasons:

- Better performance: Iceberg's design eliminates inefficient list operations that slow down Hive on object storage.
- Improved data consistency: Iceberg's file-level tracking prevents issues with missing data that can occur with Hive's folder-level approach.
- More efficient partitioning: Iceberg uses a more granular partition strategy, allowing for faster query performance.

## DuckDB & PyIceberg

DuckDB is an in-process SQL OLAP database management system, designed for fast analytical queries on local datasets6.

Using DuckDB in combination with PyIceberg offers several advantages for aggregating large volumes of data:

- Local querying: DuckDB allows for running queries locally on Iceberg tables, reducing the need for expensive cloud compute resources3.
- Efficient data loading: PyIceberg can efficiently scan Iceberg tables and load only the necessary data into DuckDB for processing3.
- SQL interface: DuckDB provides a familiar SQL interface for querying data loaded from Iceberg tables3.
- Performance optimization: DuckDB can materialize tables in memory for improved query performance on large datasets6.


By combining these technologies, data engineers and analysts can build efficient, scalable data lake solutions that leverage the strengths of object storage, modern table formats, and fast local query engines8.
